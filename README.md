## Description!

toTask is an app for anyone with a task that needs to be done, and for anyone that wants to make money completing a task.

We wanted to create an app that helps people get stuff done. If someone doesnâ€™t have the time or skill to complete everything on their todo list, they can hire a qualified person. Also, if anyone wants to make side money, they can pick up tasks to complete.  

A major goal of this project was to make a functioning MERN app that utilized simple login functionality to allow a user to sign-in and post a task.  Users then were able to view posted tasks and assign tasks to themselves and view their posted tasks and assigned tasks in their profile page.
